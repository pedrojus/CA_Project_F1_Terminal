# CA_Project_F1_Terminal
Test your F1 trivia skills by answering F1-themed questions and see if you can be number 1!

Hello!

If you are reading this, welcome to my first Python Project where I created a Formula One inspired trivia terminal game!

If you are new to Formula One, feel free to try your best as you may not know all the answers!

This trivia game has two .py files:
  1. f1.py
    - Contains the main structure of the game, including the Player class, printMenu() function that prints the menus that the player can choose from and
      displays the questions from the Categories in questions.py
    - Also, it contains a scoring system that keeps track of the player's score and monitors their input to see if they want to quit the game or select a category
      answer
  2. questions.py
    - Contains the data necessary for the trivia game to function (Questions, Answers, and appropriate points)
    - Contains the Question class that houses the question itself, its answer choices, and the correct answer
    - Contains the Category class that houses the name of the category, the list of questions
    
    
  This is a portfolio project for my Codeacademy class, feel free to add anything to the code if you think of any new features and feel free to comment your thoughts.
  
  I'm getting a lot of exposure to Python - so any constructive criticism is welcome here!
  
  Hope you enjoy!
